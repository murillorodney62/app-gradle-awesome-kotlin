### Part 2
In the previous [post](http://www.cirorizzo.net/building-a-kotlin-project/) we started a new project from scratch, and adjusted the `build.gradle` for the Kitten App purpose.

The next steps are going to be the programming of the elements of the app.

## Data Model

One of the main features of the app is to retrieve data through Internet via the `http://thecatapi.com/`

> The complete API call will be i.e. `http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=10`

The API sends back an `XML` file like this one

![XML-API](http://cirorizzo.net/content/images/2016/03/xxmlAPI.png.pagespeed.ic.CABTBWB1Ch.png)

It needs to deserialize in order to get the `url` property containing the location of the Kitten image.

Kotlin has a very useful class called `data class` that is perfect for the purpose.

Let's starting to create a new class file in the `model.cats` package using right click on it and `New->Kotlin File/Class` and call it `Cats` and choose `Class` as kind.

In order to structure the class as the `XML` file received the `Cats.kt` will be as the following

```kotlin
data class Cats(var data: Data? = null)

data class Data(var images: ArrayList<Image>? = null)

data class Image(var url: String? = "", var id: String? = "", var source_url: String? = "")
```

So far very simple...
The same class in Java is much longer!

The Kotlin Data Class has several benefits, some of them are that the compiler generates `getter()`, `setter()` and `toString()` methods, and many more like `equals()` `hashCode()` and `copy()`. So it's the perfect class to use to deserialize data

## API Call

There are many ways to retrieve data through the network, and different libraries to handle it. One of these libraries is the [Retrofit2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) library from Square.
This is a very powerful `HTTPClient` and easy to set up.

Let's start with the `interface` and create it under the `network` package.
Call it `CatAPI` as shown

```kotlin
interface CatAPI {
    @GET("/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=" + BuildConfig.MAX_IMAGES_PER_REQUEST)
    fun getCatImageURLs(): Observable<Cats>
}
```

The `interface` will manage the `Get` request to the API Endpoint `/api/images/get?format=xml&results_per_page=`.
In this case the param `results_per_page` retrieve its numerical value from the constant defined in the `build.gradle` called `MAX_IMAGES_PER_REQUEST` that will have different values depending on the `buildTypes` used.

```kotlin
buildTypes {
    debug {
        buildConfigField("int", "MAX_IMAGES_PER_REQUEST", "10")
        ...
```

> This method is very useful to have different value of constants in case we're using `debug` type or `release` one i.e. especially in case you need to access to the debug API instead of the production one

About the `interface CatAPI` is very interesting the function called to manage the callback from the API `fun getCatImageURLs(): Observable<Cats>`

So the next step is its implementation.
Let's create a new class under the same package (`network`) and call it `CatAPINetwork` as this

```kotlin
class CatAPINetwork {
    fun getExec(): Observable<Cats> {
        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
            .baseUrl("http://thecatapi.com")
            .addConverterFactory(SimpleXmlConverterFactory.create())
            .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJavaCallAdapterFactory.create())
            .build()

        val catAPI: CatAPI = retrofit.create(CatAPI::class.java)

        return catAPI.getCatImageURLs().
            subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()).
            observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    }
}
```

The `fun getExec(): Observable<Cats>` is implicitly `public` so that means available to be called by outside this class.

The line `.addConverterFactory(SimpleXmlConverterFactory.create())` indicates to use the `XML` converter to deserialize the result form the API call.

Then the `.addCallAdapterFactory(RxJavaCallAdapterFactory.create())` is the call adapter to use on the API Callback

The `return` lines referring to the `RxJava` `Observable`

```kotlin
return catAPI.getCatImageURLs().
            subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()).
            observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
```

## Presenter

The `Presenter` modules are in charge of managing the logic of the app and to bind data between the `View` and the `Model`.

In our case it will implement the method called by the `View` to retrieve the API data and send them to the `Adapter` in charge to show up.

In order to communicate with the `View` we're starting to create its `interface` called `MasterPresenter` under the package `presenter` as the followed

```kotlin
interface MasterPresenter {
    fun connect(imagesAdapter: ImagesAdapter)
    fun getMasterRequest()
}
```
