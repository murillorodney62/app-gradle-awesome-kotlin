Following my first [Kotlin blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2016/02/15/developing-spring-boot-applications-with-kotlin), today I want introduce the new Spring Boot + Kotlin application I have developed for my next week talk “Developing Geospatial Web Services with Kotlin and Spring Boot” at [Breizhcamp](http://www.breizhcamp.org/) conference.

## Dealing with native database functionalities

One of the goal of this application is to see how to take advantage of native database functionalities like we do in NoSQL world. Here we want to use Geospatial support provided by [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), the spatial database extender for [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/).

This Geospatial Messenger sample application is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sdeleuze/geospatial-messenger) in 2 flavors:
- The `master` branch uses [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed), a Kotlin SQL library with a typesafe API created by JetBrains. It could be compared to [Query DSL SQL](https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/tree/master/querydsl-sql) or [jOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/) but provides an idiomatic Kotlin API and does not require code generation.
- The [`spring-data-jdbc-repository`](https://github.com/sdeleuze/geospatial-messenger/tree/spring-data-jdbc-repository) branch is using `spring-data-jdbc-repository`, a community project that allows to use Spring Data [`PagingAndSortingRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html) API with raw SQL queries without JPA. I am using [this Jakub Jirutka fork](https://github.com/jirutka/spring-data-jdbc-repository/) which is an improved version of [Tomasz Nurkiewicz original project](https://github.com/nurkiewicz/spring-data-jdbc-repository).

A [Spring Data JPA + Hibernate Spatial variant](https://github.com/sebastianperruolo/spring-gis) would be interesting, so feel free to contribute it with a PR ;-) Kotlin Query DSL support would be also nice but this is currently not supported (please comment on [this issue](https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/issues/1828) if you are interested). In this blog post I will focus on the [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) variant.
